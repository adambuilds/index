# TODO - index

## DO NEXT

- [ ] Use `docs/wikidata-api.md` as instructions for integrating Wikidata API into the application.

## Features

- [ ] Large, omnipresent search/command bar that emulates the responsiveness of a command line interface. It should return AJAX results for character-by-character input, and allow for fuzzy matching.
- [ ] Each registered Thing should have a human-readable landing page at a fixed, semantically meaningful URL, with their most likely type as the first segment (e.g., `/element/oxygen`, `/compound/water`, `/standard/ISO-9001`).
- [ ] QR codes will be generated for each Thing, linking to its landing page. This will allow for easy sharing and referencing in physical documents or presentations.
